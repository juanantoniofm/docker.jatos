# Development Notes

## Interesting things

https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/

With those we could:

- create a random string on droplet cloud-init
- using the makefile, or not.
- store it in an env file, as JATOS_DB_PASSWORD
- load it from the compose.

And it would be an autogenerated password we could later on output.

## Done

- replace the secrets in the compose file with something prod ready. using env_file

## To Do

- Configure a certificate on the nginx
- Switch nginx with trafiek from [JATOS Docs](https://www.jatos.org/JATOS-on-DigitalOcean.html)
